Allows you to run code in Webfishing via [Finapse X](https://thunderstore.io/c/webfishing/p/TeamFishnet/FinapseX/) :3 -TeamFishnet üêüü•Ö

add smokedoutlocedout on discord for support

## Tips:   
- Get the [godot-tools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=geequlim.godot-tools) extension and launch the decompiled game in GodotSteam for a live API
- Add BlueberryWolf's PlayerAPI as its own global variable in your autoload settings to expose its functions to the language server 
- set a keybind for the extension's action to quickly run scripts
- use Finapse's internal UI's trash button to delete previously executed scripts to stop loops, signal connections, etc.

## Dependencies:
- ws
- vscode

## Credits:
This extension is heavily based on nexure's [synapse-execute](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=nexure.synapse-executor) extension
