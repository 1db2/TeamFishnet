## About

Lets you run scripts in-game without using the editor or recompiling mods for debugging, developing and other shenanigans

### Features

* Visual Studio Code integration via [extension](https://github.com/d29l/TeamFishnet/blob/main/Finapse%20X/vsc%20extension.zip)
* customizable keybind to open and close (Default F1)
* totally original name and ui (rip Synapse)
* syntax highlighting and codemap (I wish CodeEdit was a 3.5 node)
* built-in `PlayerAPI`, `KeybindsAPI` libraries and `localPlayer` variable
* open and save scripts as `.gd` files
* button to delete previously executed scripts (stop infinite loops!)
